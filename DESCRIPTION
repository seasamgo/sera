Title: Infer seqFISH expression patterns using scRNA-seq data
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Integrate the expression matrices of seqFISH and scRNA-seq data to infer spatial
    expression patterns in three steps: normalize against sequencing-technology specific 
    gene expression distribution differences, implement a multi-response LASSO regression for 
    predictor gene selection and transcriptome-level estimation, determine estimable genes for 
    the small subset of predictor genes using a local polynomial regression against the penalized 
    coefficient L1 norm and estimate variation threshold.
